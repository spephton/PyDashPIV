why Dash?
what should the finished product do?

\subsection{Aims}
Specifically, this project aims to:
\begin{itemize}
\item develop a useful and user-friendly PIV application. This will involve: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item determining the specific requirements of the end user, deciding which features must be present and which features are simply nice-to-have, prioritising feature and product development.
	\item Determining the hardware and software operating environment
	\item Determining the physical test equipment the software is to be used with
	\item Creating 
\end{itemize}
